# Brain-metabolism-and-connectivity-dynamics
This repository contains the scripts used for the study "Multiscale excitation-inhibition balance dynamics: integrating metabolite kinetics with time-varying executive networks"



Sample code to reproduce results of the manuscript "X" by Saviola et al., bioRxiv 2024. https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2024.10.30.621153v1

The code generates Fig.X of the paper and X analysis. More comment and details are provided within the main scripts (i.e., "X"). Some sample data (i.e. mainly behaviour) are included in the repo to make the code standalone.

Please note that the code for functional and structural image preprocessing can be downloaded from: [https://github.com/MIPLabCH/myPLS](https://github.com/tambalostefano/lnifmri_prep)
Please note that the code for the dynamic connectivity analysis (Fig. 2) can be downloaded from: [https://github.com/MIPLabCH/TbCAPs](https://github.com/MIPLabCH/TbCAPs)
Please note that the code for Partial Least Square Correlation (Fig. 3) can be downloaded from: [https://github.com/MIPLabCH/myPLS](https://github.com/MIPLabCH/myPLS)
